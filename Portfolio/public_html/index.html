					You might be wondering who is this lovely looking girl in the picture.
					Isnt this meant to be Josip's site? Well, that is true, but it wouldn't be
					Josip's site if I didn't include her. She is someone amazing. She is someone that changed
					his life for the better by a lot. She influenced him greatly, and made him always try to
					be better.
